 Dzcomm is gift-ware. It was created by a number of people working in
 cooperation, and is given to you freely as a gift. You may use, modify,
 redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like, and you do
 not have to give us anything in return. However, if you like this product
 you are encouraged to thank us by making a return gift to the dzcomm
 community. This could be by writing an add-on package, providing a useful
 bug report, making an improvement to the library, or perhaps just
 releasing the sources of your program so that other people can learn from
 them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make something using it,
 it would be nice if you mentioned dzcomm somewhere in the credits, but you
 are not required to do this. We trust you not to abuse our generosity.
